Alternative firmware for Espressif's ESP8266 MCU based devices.

What distinguishes it from other implementations is that it's event driven
and completly asynchrounous, which means ultra speed and responsiveness.

It's also designed to facilitate implementation of new device drivers,
and provides you with framework for fast and easy development.
